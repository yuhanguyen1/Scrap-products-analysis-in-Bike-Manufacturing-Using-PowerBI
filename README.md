## 🧠 Design Thinking Process  

1️⃣ **Empathize** → Understand production managers’ need for real-time performance and quality dashboards  
2️⃣ **Define** → Focus on efficiency, quality, and cost optimization  
3️⃣ **Ideate** → Map key KPIs (Orders, Quantity, On-Time Rate, Scrap Rate, Avg Production, Avg Delay Days)  
4️⃣ **Prototype & Review** → Build iterative dashboards with 3 lenses: **Manufacturing Overview, Process & Resource Performance, Quality & Cost**

## 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations  

### I. Manufacturing Overview  
<img width="1429" height="802" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/976ccc53-ee7d-4996-bc5e-d7b829b258ad" />

📌 **Findings:**  
1. **Order Volume Growth** – Total orders at **73K (+11.9% vs LY)**, total quantity at **4M (+10.2% vs LY)**.  
2. **On-Time Rate Stable** – Maintained at **69%**, with a slight decline (-3.4% vs LY).  
3. **Scrap Rate Increase** – Rose to **0.24% (+14% vs LY)**, indicating quality concerns.  
4. **Production Efficiency** – Average production at **13.24 hours**, up slightly (+2% vs LY).  
5. **Delay Impact** – Average delay days at **5.6 days (+11% vs LY)**, affecting delivery timelines.

### II. Process & Resource Performance  
<img width="1432" height="799" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/596edb61-0d4b-471a-805a-3ff0834c62b3" />

📌 **Findings:**  
1. **Scrap Rate Trend** – Increased from **0.13% (2011) to 0.12% (2014)**, peaking in mid-2014.  
2. **Resource Allocation** – Components dominate resource hours (e.g., 12K hours in December), Bikes at ~4K hours.  
3. **Work Order Completion** – Majority completed within 0-16 days, 7K orders >20 days.  
4. **Queue Time Variation** – Average queue time across locations ranges from **3.9 to 4.3 days**.  
5. **Time Share Distribution** – Operation sequence 8 has the highest average time share (0.83 days).

### III. Quality & Cost  
<img width="1427" height="801" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6992ffcc-f3d5-4199-8cd9-59c048c76192" />

📌 **Findings:**  
1. **Cost Variance** – Actual cost ($3.36B) exceeds standard cost ($125.1M) by **$3.36B**, driven by HL Road Handlebars.  
2. **Scrap Cost Distribution** – Final Assembly incurs the highest scrap cost (~145K), Specialized at ~15K.  
3. **Primary Scrap Reasons** – Trim length issues (673 units) and wheel misalignment (314 units) top the list.  
4. **Delay & Late Work Orders** – Sequence 4 shows 5.6 days delay and 22.4% late orders.  
5. **On-Time vs Scrap Rate** – Location 50 has the lowest on-time rate (0.11%) and highest scrap rate (0.18%).

## 🔎 Final Conclusion & Recommendation  

### 📌 1. Market Expansion  
- **Insight:** Resource allocation shows Bikes as the primary focus, with Components underutilized.  
- **Recommendation:**  
  - Optimize **resource allocation** to balance Bikes and Components production.  
  - Invest in **automation for high-delay locations** (e.g., Location 50).  
  - Monitor **scrap cost trends** in Final Assembly to reduce waste.  

---

### 📌 2. Product Portfolio  
- **Insight:** HL Road Handlebars and HL Mountain Frame show significant cost variances.  
- **Recommendation:**  
  - Review **manufacturing processes** for high-variance products (e.g., Handlebars).  
  - Develop **quality checks** for Frames to reduce scrap (e.g., Trim length issues).  
  - Phase out or redesign **underperforming SKUs** with high scrap rates.  

---

### 📌 3. Operations & Efficiency  
- **Insight:** Delays (5.6 days) and scrap rates (0.24%) indicate inefficiencies in sequences 4 and 5.  
- **Recommendation:**  
  - Shorten **queue times** in high-delay locations (e.g., 4.3 days at Location 60).  
  - Implement **preventive measures** for top scrap reasons (Trim length, Wheel misalignment).  
  - Replicate **efficient processes** from low-delay locations (e.g., Location 10).  

---

### ✨ Overall Business Impact  
Implementing these recommendations will enable:  
- **Improved production efficiency** through optimized resource allocation and reduced delays.  
- **Reduced scrap and cost variance** via targeted quality improvements.  
- **Enhanced operational performance** through process optimization and waste reduction.
